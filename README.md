# Nymserver Tools

These tools, which I originally built in 2002 and apparently updated a little bit in 2007, are tools for interacting with an anonymous Nym server, such as [Nymserv](https://github.com/pymander/nymserv).

## Usage

`buildblock.pl` is a tool for creating reply blocks for anonymous remailers. Creating easy-to-use, easily discarded reply blocks is pretty essential. I can't remember if this was ever implemented properly, but a reply block is safest if it's only used once.

`anondecode.pl` was originally a tool that I used with procmail to decode incoming pseudonym messages, because they'd be encrypted and formatted in strange ways.

If these scripts are interesting to you, please enjoy them.
